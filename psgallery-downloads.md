The AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell lets developers and administrators manage their AWS services from the Windows PowerShell scripting environment.
This version of AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell is compatible with Windows PowerShell 2-5.1. An alternative module, AWSPowerShell.NetCore, provides support for Windows PowerShell 3+ and PowerShell Core 6+ on Windows, Linux and macOS.
This product provides support for all AWS services in a single module. As an alternative, a modular variant is also available: separate smaller modules (e.g. AWS.Tools.EC2, AWS.Tools.S3...) allow managing each AWS Service.

This version of AWS Tools for PowerShell is compatible with Windows PowerShell 5.1+ and PowerShell Core 6+ on Windows, Linux and macOS. When running on Windows PowerShell, .NET Framework 4.7.2 or newer is required.
Alternative modules, AWSPowerShell.NetCore and AWSPowerShell, provide support for all AWS services from a single module and also support older versions of Windows PowerShell and .NET Framework.

PowerNSX is a PowerShell module that abstracts the VMware NSX API to a set of easily used PowerShell functions.
This module is not supported by VMware, and comes with no warranties express or implied. Please test and validate its functionality before using in a production environment.
It aims to focus on exposing New, Update, Remove and Get operations for all key NSX functions as well as adding additional functionality to extend the capabilities of NSX management beyond the native UI or API.
It is unlikely that it will ever expose 100% of the NSX API, but feature requests are welcomed if you find a particular function you require to be lacking.
PowerNSX is currently a work in progress and is not yet feature complete.

## [ThreadJob](https://www.powershellgallery.com/Packages/ThreadJob/2.0.3) | 2.0.3

### Published: 12/20/2019 16:37:53 by Microsoft Corporation

PowerShell's built-in BackgroundJob jobs (Start-Job) are run in separate processes on the local machine.
They provide excellent isolation but are resource heavy.  Running hundreds of BackgroundJob jobs can quickly
absorb system resources.

This module extends the existing PowerShell BackgroundJob to include a new thread based ThreadJob job.  This is a 
lighter weight solution for running concurrent PowerShell scripts that works within the existing PowerShell job 
infrastructure.

ThreadJob jobs will tend to run quicker because there is lower overhead and they do not use the remoting serialization 
system.  And they will use up fewer system resources.  In addition output objects returned from the job will be
'live' since they are not re-hydrated from the serialization system.  However, there is less isolation.  If one
ThreadJob job crashes the process then all ThreadJob jobs running in that process will be terminated.

This module exports a single cmdlet, Start-ThreadJob, which works similarly to the existing Start-Job cmdlet.
The main difference is that the jobs which are created run in separate threads within the local process.

One difference is that ThreadJob jobs support a ThrottleLimit parameter to limit the number of running jobs,
and thus active threads, at a time.  If more jobs are started then they go into a queue and wait until the current
number of jobs drops below the throttle limit.

Source for this module is at GitHub.  Please submit any issues there.
https://github.com/PaulHigin/PSThreadJob

Added Runspace cleanup.
Added Using variable expression support.
Added StreamingHost parameter to stream host data writes to a provided host object.
Added Information stream handling.
Bumped version to 2.0.0, and now only support PowerShell version 5.1 and higher.
Fixed using keyword bug with PowerShell preview version, and removed unneeded version check.
Added setting current working directory to running jobs, when available.
Added help URI to module.
